### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

#### Input Slider styling
I would like to continue working on styling different components that I have not had much experience working with such as the input slider. It was great to work on something new and I want to continue working on the slider and 
other different components in future projects.

#### Sass
I have started using Sass more in my projects and as I am still a beginner working on it, I want to continue working on my understanding on it so I can be more efficient with it and be able to improve the quality of my work.
